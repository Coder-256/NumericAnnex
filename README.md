# NumericAnnex

NumericAnnex is meant to supplement numeric facilities provided in the Swift
standard library. It is in the earliest stages of development and most
definitely not production-ready. Currently implemented are:

- [x] `Math` and `FloatingPointMath` protocols
- [x] `Complex`

## Future directions

Near-term goals:
- [ ] Many more tests
- [ ] `Rational`

Later goals:
- [ ] `BigInt`
- [ ] `Random`
